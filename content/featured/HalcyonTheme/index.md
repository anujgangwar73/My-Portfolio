To-Do List project is an application specially built to keep track of errands or tasks that need to be done. This application will be like a task keeper where the user would be able to enter the tasks that they need to do. The four major tasks that we can perform in a TODO list are:
<ul>
<li>Add tasks</li>
<li>Update tasks</li>
<li>Read tasks</li>
<li>Delete tasks</li>
</ul>
